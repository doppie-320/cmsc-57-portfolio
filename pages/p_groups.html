                Nevermind what I said, THIS subject is the most difficult one I have come across so far. Quite literally, this topic left me wordless and as such, this section wonâ€™t be as wordy. Though, it is easy in a sense in that as long as you have a checklist, or memorize and evaluate each condition for Groups, Rings and Fields properly you can accurately categorize a set into one of the three. But what really gets you is the intricacies: you get an item correct and you think you already understood it but the next item completely makes your current understanding crumble into the wind. However, despite having a love-hate relationship with this topic, I must respect it, as many of the topics in CS that I love are built on the foundations of algebraic structures, such as Error Correcting Code and Memory, Compression Algorithms and even cryptography.
                <br><br>After all, who am I to hate on a topic in which built upon it is the topics I dearly love?
